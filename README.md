# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection & Segmentation with YOLOv11 + SAM2

This project uses **YOLOv11** (object detection) and **SAM2** (Segment Anything Model) to detect and segment brain tumors from MRI images.

## 🚀 Features

- Trained on brain tumor MRI dataset
- Multi-class tumor detection: **glioma**, **meningioma**, **pituitary**, **no_tumor**
- Real-time bounding box prediction using YOLOv11
- Pixel-level segmentation using SAM2
- Easily test new MRI scans with your own image

---

## 🧪 Test Your Own MRI Image

Upload an image and run detection + segmentation:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO, SAM

model = YOLO("best.pt")
sam = SAM("sam2_b.pt")

results = model("your_mri.jpg")
for r in results:
    if r.boxes:
        masks = sam(r.orig_img, bboxes=r.boxes.xyxy, save=True, device=0)
````

Segmented images are saved in: `runs/segment/predict/`

---

## 📊 Training Results

YOLOv11 was trained for 20 epochs with:

* ✅ Custom dataset
* ✅ `640x640` image size
* ✅ Early stopping, GPU acceleration

Key result files:

* `val_batch0_pred.png`
* `results.png`
* `confusion_matrix.png`

## 🧠 Inspiration

This project idea came from real experiences — friends sending MRI scans for quick checks. Now, we use AI to assist in identifying tumor regions faster and more accurately.
